## About
This project is design to search for an artist, or band by using APIs, some of the information that we will obtain are: Short Biography, Famous song, popular albums, and important YouTube videos. 


## Before you Start: 
Before you start, you will need to create API keys from Spotify and YouTube to run the app properly as we are using these keys to request to their services for artist data retrieval:
Spotify API
Link: "https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api"
NOTE: (For the Spotify API key setup process, you will be prompted to give the project app URL when in the process of making an account with them. Input: "http://127.0.0.1:5001" as the URL for the project)

YouTubeAPI
Link: "https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started"

# Once both API keys are created and you have access to them, you will need to set up a .env file. Please look at the file, " .env_example" and copy everything from there to a new file called, ".env" in your root directory. 

# Once that file is created, update the .env file where it has quotes as the values replacing it with your OWN actual API keys inside those quotes. The '.env' is already in the '.gitignore' file so no need to add it there again. DO NOT DELETE THE ".env_example" file as this will be used globally for setup for other users.
